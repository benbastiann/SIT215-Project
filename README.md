# Reinforcement Learning problems investigation
## Projects overview
In this repository, I'll walk through some of the popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems, build the non-RL and RL solutions for each to compare the efficiency and time-consuming. The problems include:

- Taxi problem (will be solved with "Random Policy solution" and "Q-learning" solution)
- Cart Pole problem (will be solved in (will be solved with "Random Search solution" and "Q-learning" solution)
- Mountain Car problem (will be solved in 2 different RL methods: "Q-learning" and "TD-learning")

## My presentation of RL, all the mentioned problems and methods applied explanation (with code and efficiency comparison:
